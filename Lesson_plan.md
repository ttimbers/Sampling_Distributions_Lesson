## Sampling Distributions Lesson Plan (55 minute lesson)

## Student orientated learning goals:
*
*
*

## Required materials

* Whiteboard
* 3 decks of playing cards
* Laptop (for tutor and each student) with internet access
* Overhead projector

## Lesson

### 1. Motivation (2.5 minutes). 
	* basis for inferential statistics
	* e.g., will be extremely useful when we want to determine if two (or more) samples
		are derived from the same or different populations (mean weight loss after 4 weeks
		on a low-carb diet versus those on a high-carb diet)

### 2. Mean of the sampling distribution is equal to the mean of the population 
(15 minutes)

The concepts of population distribution, sample distribution, sampling distribution, 
population mean, sample mean and central limit theorem will be introduced via an 
interactive and live demonstration. This demonstration will also illustrate the concept
that the mean of the sampling distribution is equal to the mean of the population.

Three decks of cards will be assembled ahead of time (using only cards of value ace - ten)
so that they have a known bimodal distribution. This distribution will also have been 
plotted as a histogram in a figure ahead of time. 

This deck of cards will represent the 'population'. The deck of cards will be passed to 
each student in class, they will shuffle the deck and then deal themselves 5 cards. They
will write these numbers down, and pass the deck onto the next student. Each student will
calculate the mean from the cards they dealt themselves, and they will share that value 
with the class. Each student's sample mean will be added to a histogram on the whiteboard
and together we will generate a sampling distribution for the sample mean. 

We can then compare the sampling distribution and the mean of the sampling distribution to
the population distribution and its mean. This will demonstrate graphically that the mean 
of the sampling distribution is equal to (or at least very close to) the mean of the 
population.

### 3. Two other important principles about regarding the sampling distribution and the 
population distribution (10 min)

Using an [online simulation]() and a shared [Google spreadsheet]() we will explore the 
effect of sample size on the sampling distribution. The goal will be to demonstrate that:
	* When the sample size is sufficiently large, the shape of the sampling distribution is approximately normal irrespective of the shape of the population distribution.
	* The standard deviation of the sampling distribution is equal to the standard deviation of the population distribution divided by the square root of the sample size (n).

Each student will be assigned an number from (ranging from 2 - 100). The student will 
complete a sampling distribution simulation using the assigned numbers as the sample size
and the following additional parameters: x, y, and z). 

After completing the simulation, the students will copy and paste the values they obtained 
for the sampling distribution's standard deviation, skew and kurtosis into the correct 
cell in the shared Google spreadsheet. The Google spreadsheet has previously been set-up 
such that when students paste the values from their simulations into the appropriate cells 
the spreadsheet adds those values to plots for sample size versus standard deviation,
sample size versus skew, and sample size versus kurtosis. 

Once the spreadsheet has been populated the class will discuss their observations. The instructor will guide and focus
the discussion around the two key principles: increasing sample size increases how normal
the shape of the sampling distribution is, and increasing sample size decreases the 
standard deviation of the sampling distribution.

### 4. Socrative quiz (5 min)

An free online quizzing tool, [Socrative](http://www.socrative.com/) will be used to 
administer 3 short multiple choice questions to uncover any misconceptions that may have 
come about during the last two exercises. If any are apparent, time will be taken to 
correct and clarify. The following three questions will be used:

	1.

	2.

	3.

### 5. Applications of the sampling distribution (5 min)



### 6. Group problem solving (15 min)

Students will work in groups of 3 to try to solve the problems below. The answers to the
first will be taken up in class, and the answers to all are available online [here]().

	1.

	2.

	3.


### 7. Wrap-up (2.5 min)
