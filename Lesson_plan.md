# Sampling Distributions Lesson Plan (55 minute lesson)
by Tiffany Timbers </br>
January 26, 2016 </br>

## After this lesson students will be able to:
* Define a population and sampling distribution
* Describe the Central limit theorem with regards to the relationship between the population and sampling distributions
* Explain the relationship between sample size and a sampling distribution's standard deviation and shape
* Predict the probability of of observing values less than, or greater than a cutoff, given a population mean and standard deviation, as well as a sample size.

## Required materials

* Whiteboard
* 3 decks of playing cards
* Laptop (for tutor and each student) with internet access
* Overhead projector

## Lesson

### 1. Motivation (2.5 minutes). 
* Sampling distributions are the basis for inferential statistics
* A solid understanding of sampling distributions will be extremely useful when we want to determine if two (or more) samples are derived from the same or different populations (weight lost after 4 weeks on a low-carb diet versus those on a high-carb diet)

### 2. Mean of the sampling distribution is equal to the mean of the population (15 minutes)

The concepts of population distribution, sample distribution, sampling distribution, 
population mean, sample mean and central limit theorem will be introduced via an 
interactive and live demonstration. This demonstration will also illustrate the concept
that the mean of the sampling distribution is equal to the mean of the population.

Three decks of cards will be assembled ahead of time (using only cards of value ace - ten)
so that they have [this](https://github.com/ttimbers/Sampling_Distributions_Lesson/blob/master/card_population_distribution.pdf) 
known bimodal distribution.

This deck of cards will represent the 'population'. The deck of cards will be passed to 
each student in class, they will shuffle the deck and then deal themselves 5 cards. They
will write these numbers down, and pass the deck onto the next student. Each student will
calculate the mean from the cards they dealt themselves, and they will share that value 
with the class. Each student's sample mean will be added to a histogram on the whiteboard
and together we will generate a sampling distribution for the sample mean. 

We can then compare the sampling distribution and the mean of the sampling distribution to
the population distribution and its mean. This will demonstrate graphically that the mean 
of the sampling distribution is equal to (or at least very close to) the mean of the 
population.

### 3. Two other important principles about regarding the sampling distribution and the population distribution (10 min)

Using an [online simulation](http://onlinestatbook.com/stat_sim/sampling_dist/) and a 
shared [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MuDUEfBvjma_jqw3I4IhEP4nXnJAe0uAIPuKxBQeELs/edit?usp=sharing) 
we will explore the effect of sample size on the sampling distribution. The goal will be 
to demonstrate that:
* When the sample size is sufficiently large, the shape of the sampling distribution is approximately normal irrespective of the shape of the population distribution.
* The standard deviation of the sampling distribution is equal to the standard deviation of the population distribution divided by the square root of the sample size (n).

Each student will be assigned a sample size number. The student will complete a sampling 
distribution simulation using the assigned numbers as the sample size and the following 
additional parameters: Skewed and Mean). 

After completing the simulation, the students will copy and paste the values they obtained 
for the sampling distribution's standard deviation, skew and kurtosis into the correct 
cell in the shared Google spreadsheet. The Google spreadsheet has previously been set-up 
such that when students paste the values from their simulations into the appropriate cells 
the spreadsheet adds those values to plots for sample size versus standard deviation,
sample size versus skew, and sample size versus kurtosis. 

Once the spreadsheet has been populated the class will discuss their observations. The 
instructor will guide and focus the discussion around the two key principles: increasing 
sample size increases how normal the shape of the sampling distribution is, and increasing 
sample size decreases the standard deviation of the sampling distribution.

### 4. Socrative quiz (5 min)

A free online quizzing tool, [Socrative](http://www.socrative.com/) will be used to 
administer short multiple choice questions to uncover any misconceptions that may have 
come about during the last two exercises. If any are apparent, time will be taken to 
correct and clarify. The following questions will be used (correct answers are highlighted 
in **bold**):

i. Which of the following are not true: </br>
a) as you increase the sample size, the standard deviation of the sampling distribution will decrease </br>
**b) as you increase the sample size, the mean of the sampling distribution approaches the mean of the population distribution** </br>
c) the mean of the sampling distribution is equal to the mean of the population distribution </br>
d) as you increase the sample size, the sampling distribution becomes more normally distributed </br>

ii. Which answer(s) below are true about the sample distribution: </br>
**a) it closely resembles the population distribution** </br>
b) it becomes more normally distributed as you increase the sample size </br>
c) as you increase the sample size, the standard deviation of the sample distribution will decrease </br>

### 5. Applications of the sampling distribution (5 min)

How to use what we have just learned about the sampling distribution to solve an applied
problem (outlined below) will be demonstrated to the class. 

You are planning a day of sailing on the ocean on a very large boat for 40 people and you 
plan to bring 112 L of water. The average human is recommended to drink 2.6 L of water 
each day (with a standard deviation of 0.8 L). What is the probability that you will run 
out of water?

### 6. Group problem solving (15 min)

Students will work in groups of 3 to try to solve the problems below. The answers to the
first will be taken up in class, and the answers to all will be made available online 
after class.

i. The speeds of vehicles in a school zone have a mean of 36 km/h with a standard 
deviation of 6 km/h, despite the speed limit being 30 km/h. What is the probability that 
the mean speed of the next 20 cars will be less than the speed limit?

ii. The mean gas bill for all detached homes in Narniaville is $65 a month with a standard 
deviation of $15. What is the probability that a random sample of 50 households in 
Narniaville will be more than the population mean by at least $5.

iii. You've been hired as a data scientist at a Steel Mill. One of the products they 
produce is Rebar with a mean length of 3 m and a standard deviation of 0.01 m. During the
monthly quality control process an inspector measures the length of 10 randomly sampled 
pieces of rebar to determine if the machine that cuts the rebar needs to be recalibrated.
The inspector makes this call if the mean of the sampled rebar is less than 2.995 m or 
greater than 3.05. The next inspection is tomorrow, what is the probability that it will
be decided that the cutting machine needs to be recalibrated?

### 7. Wrap-up (2.5 min)

Draw a concept map on the whiteboard of information/ideas/lessons learned. The concept map
is to be student driven, but can be guided by the tutor if necessary. A photo will be 
taken of the concept map and posted to the course website.
