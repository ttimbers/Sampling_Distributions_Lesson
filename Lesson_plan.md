# Sampling Distributions Lesson Plan 
by Tiffany Timbers
(estimated 55 minute lesson)

## After this lesson students will be able to:
* Define a population and sampling distribution
* Describe the Central limit theorem with regards to the relationship between the population and sampling distributions
* Explain the relationship between sample size and a sampling distribution's standard deviation and shape
* Predict the probability of of observing values less than, or greater than a cutoff, given a population mean and standard deviation, as well as a sample size.

## Required materials

* Whiteboard
* 3 decks of playing cards
* Laptop (for tutor and each student) with internet access
* Overhead projector

## Lesson

### 1. Motivation (2.5 minutes). 
* Basis for inferential statistics
* Will be extremely useful when we want to determine if two (or more) samples are derived from the same or different populations (mean weight loss after 4 weeks on a low-carb diet versus those on a high-carb diet)

### 2. Mean of the sampling distribution is equal to the mean of the population (15 minutes)

The concepts of population distribution, sample distribution, sampling distribution, 
population mean, sample mean and central limit theorem will be introduced via an 
interactive and live demonstration. This demonstration will also illustrate the concept
that the mean of the sampling distribution is equal to the mean of the population.

Three decks of cards will be assembled ahead of time (using only cards of value ace - ten)
so that they have [this](https://github.com/ttimbers/Sampling_Distributions_Lesson/blob/master/card_population_distribution.pdf) 
known bimodal distribution.

This deck of cards will represent the 'population'. The deck of cards will be passed to 
each student in class, they will shuffle the deck and then deal themselves 5 cards. They
will write these numbers down, and pass the deck onto the next student. Each student will
calculate the mean from the cards they dealt themselves, and they will share that value 
with the class. Each student's sample mean will be added to a histogram on the whiteboard
and together we will generate a sampling distribution for the sample mean. 

We can then compare the sampling distribution and the mean of the sampling distribution to
the population distribution and its mean. This will demonstrate graphically that the mean 
of the sampling distribution is equal to (or at least very close to) the mean of the 
population.

### 3. Two other important principles about regarding the sampling distribution and the population distribution (10 min)

Using an [online simulation](http://onlinestatbook.com/stat_sim/sampling_dist/) and a 
shared [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MuDUEfBvjma_jqw3I4IhEP4nXnJAe0uAIPuKxBQeELs/edit?usp=sharing) 
we will explore the effect of sample size on the sampling distribution. The goal will be 
to demonstrate that:
* When the sample size is sufficiently large, the shape of the sampling distribution is approximately normal irrespective of the shape of the population distribution.
* The standard deviation of the sampling distribution is equal to the standard deviation of the population distribution divided by the square root of the sample size (n).

Each student will be assigned a sample size number. The student will complete a sampling 
distribution simulation using the assigned numbers as the sample size and the following 
additional parameters: Skewed and Mean). 

After completing the simulation, the students will copy and paste the values they obtained 
for the sampling distribution's standard deviation, skew and kurtosis into the correct 
cell in the shared Google spreadsheet. The Google spreadsheet has previously been set-up 
such that when students paste the values from their simulations into the appropriate cells 
the spreadsheet adds those values to plots for sample size versus standard deviation,
sample size versus skew, and sample size versus kurtosis. 

Once the spreadsheet has been populated the class will discuss their observations. The 
instructor will guide and focus the discussion around the two key principles: increasing 
sample size increases how normal the shape of the sampling distribution is, and increasing 
sample size decreases the standard deviation of the sampling distribution.

### 4. Socrative quiz (5 min)

A free online quizzing tool, [Socrative](http://www.socrative.com/) will be used to 
administer short multiple choice questions to uncover any misconceptions that may have 
come about during the last two exercises. If any are apparent, time will be taken to 
correct and clarify. The following questions will be used (correct answers are highlighted 
in bold):

i. Which of the following are not true:
a) as you increase the sample size, the standard deviation of the sampling distribution will decrease
**b) as you increase the sample size, the mean of the sampling distribution approaches the mean of the population distribution**
c) the mean of the sampling distribution is equal to the mean of the population distribution
d) as you increase the sample size, the sampling distribution becomes more normally distributed

ii. Which answer(s) below are true about the sample distribution:
**a) it closely resembles the population distribution**
b) it becomes more normally distributed as you increase the sample size
c) as you increase the sample size, the standard deviation of the sample distribution will decrease

### 5. Applications of the sampling distribution (5 min)

How to use what we have just learned about the sampling distribution to solve an applied
problem (outlined below) will be demonstrated to the class. 

The average human is recommended to drink 2.6 L of water each day (with a standard 
deviation of 0.8 L). You are planning a day of outdoor activities for 40 people and you 
plan to bring 112 L of water. What is the probability that you will run out of water?

### 6. Group problem solving (15 min)

Students will work in groups of 3 to try to solve the problems below. The answers to the
first will be taken up in class, and the answers to all will be made available online 
after class.

i. In a highway construction zone with a posted speed limit of 40 miles per hour, the 
speeds of all vehicles are normally distributed with a mean of 46 mph and a standard 
deviation of 3 mph. Find the probability that the mean speed of a random sample of 20 cars 
traveling through this construction zone is less than 45.5 mph.

ii. The amounts of electric bills for all households in a city have a skewed probability 
distribution with a mean of $80 and a standard deviation of $25. Find the probability that 
the mean amount of electric bills for a random sample of 75 households selected from this 
city will be more than the population mean by at least $5

iii. A machine at Katz Steel Corporation makes 3-inch-long nails. The probability 
distribution of the lengths of these nails is normal with a mean of 3 inches and a 
standard deviation of .1 inch. The quality control inspector takes a sample of 25 nails 
once a week and calculates the mean length of these nails. If the mean of this sample is 
either less than 2.95 inches or greater than 3.05 inches, the inspector concludes that the 
machine needs an adjustment. What is the probability that based on a sample of 25 nails 
the inspector will conclude that the machine needs an adjustment?

### 7. Wrap-up (2.5 min)

Draw a concept map on the whiteboard of information/ideas/lessons learned. The concept map
is to be student driven, but can be guided by the tutor if necessary. A photo will be 
taken of the concept map and posted to the course website.
